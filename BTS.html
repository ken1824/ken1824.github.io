<h1>Introduction to BTS</h1>
<a href=""><img src="images/BTSgrp.jpg"width="249px"height="190px"class="fltrt"title="grp"></a>
<p><br>BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys,
 is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
 The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.</br>
<br>Awards: Mnet Asian Music Award for Artist of the Year, MORE Trending
Founded: 2013, Seoul, South Korea
Origin: Seoul, South Korea (2013).</br>
<br>Albums: Map of the Soul: 7, Wings, Love Yourself: Tear, MORE.
BTS's music is also a success because of the subject of their music. While many K-pop songs are about relationships and love, BTS covers subjects that other bands may not like bullying, elitism, and mental health. Their ability to be relatable, humble while still being entertaining is rare.</br></p>
